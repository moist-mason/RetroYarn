## Retro Yarn ##

This is an informal project aiming to "downdate" Yarn mappings as much as I possibly can. 

**This repository is not intended as a substitute or competitor to [Legacy Fabric](https://github.com/Legacy-Fabric/yarn)**. If I ever get around to filling in mappings for pre-1.14
versions, you are completely welcome to submit them to their repo.

*I envision this project as having two stages:*
1. Update prior versions until 1.14 (what I'm currently working on)
2. Once older versions are mostly updated, I intend on going to before 1.14 as far back as I can to create intermediaries and yarn mappings for that.

This repo does host uploads of Fabric intermediary and Yarn TinyV2 files, as both are hosted on the Creative Commons Zero license.
